# Random Password Generator

## Creating a Random Password Generator

I was asked to make a password generator that would prompt the user to ask how long they wanted the password between 8-128 characters, and if they wanted uppercase, lowercase, and/or special characters added to their password. If the password length is too long or too short, the password generator will alert the user and restart the process until the password length is between 8 and 128 characters.
